### <i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Getting Started 
If you have little experience with wiring with electronics, then it is strongly recommended to read up on the proper precautions that need to be taken [here](https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/21-safety-rules-for-working-with-electrical-equipment). Along a similar vein, if you have never soldered, then a breadboard can be used to wire the whole project. Breadboard connections are less durable than a solder joint, but jumper cables allow you to avoid soldering.

Building an automatic liquid handler follows many of the principles used by DIYers to build 3D printers and CNC routers, which are found in many households. It is recommended to watch videos such as this [one](https://youtu.be/qub5chyIQ0s) to learn the operating principles behind stepper motors, stepper drivers, limit switches, etc. 

### <i class="fas fa-plug"></i> Electrical System Components
Roughly there are three main parts of OTTO's electrical system:
- The microcontroller
- The stepper drivers and motors
- Sensors and buttons
