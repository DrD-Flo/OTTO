The prices listed in the table were compiled on July 1, 2020. The components were selected to minimize the number of vendors to source all the parts. More expensive components like the Balluff fork sensors and the Haydon-Kerk NEMA 11 linear actuator can be found at lower prices on the second-hand market. The pipette tip sensors can be constructed from either Balluff fork sensors for contactless probing or from mechanical switches for a more cost affordable solution (see below).

A fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printer with a build volume of at least 203 x 232 x 203 mm is required to print all the parts. Approximately 3 kg of filament is needed to print the required number of parts at 20% infill. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a suitable print material. However, it is recommended that the Floating Head Plate is machined out of aluminum or printed out of a stiff filament (e.g., a carbon fiber composite) for increased rigidity of the floating head assembly. STL and STEP files for each component is provided as separate supplemental material.
