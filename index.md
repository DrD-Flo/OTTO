title: OTTO: The Open-Source and Affordable Liquid Handler for Automated Micropipetting
---
### Open-Source Liquid Handler

OTTO is a liquid handler that can automatically prepare samples for qPCR, flow cytometry, and other biological assays that rely on accurate liquid dispensing. Otto is also:
* a linear motion platform that balances speed and accuracy for timely sample preparation
* capable of lights out sample preparation (set it up and walk away!)
* constructed entirely from open-source parts
* affordable, costing ~$1500

### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> About the Inventors
OTTO was the brainchild of David Florian, who is a graduate student in Dr. Scott Guelcherâ€™s lab at Vanderbilt. With the help of his advisor and a passionate group of undergraduates (Mateusz Odziomek, Cerie Ock, and Hannah Chen), David brought OTTO to life.
