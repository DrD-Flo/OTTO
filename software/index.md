### <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python 3 Interface 
Interaction with Otto is accomplished through a graphical user interface (GUI) coded in Python 3 using Tkinter and Tk themed widgets. This allows for a simple, yet comprehensive interface through which to utilize all of OTTO’s capabilities. When the GUI is opened, users are presented with a choice of assays and equipment setup. After selecting their preference, users will then have the ability to calibrate OTTO, configure their plate setup or run their plates. The Python program effectively serves as a “translator/interpreter” between the user’s inputs and the Arduino Due which has direct connections to the motors. 

### <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> Arduino Due
The Arduino Due is running a custom lightweight G-code firmware that receives and translates G-code generated by Python program and translates these coordinates into motor movements. To learn more about G-Code click [here](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code). To keep the firmware simple, the Due can only recognize necessary G-code commands, such as:
- G1 Movement commands (e.g., G1 X30 Y15 Z20 E5, where E refers to the pipette linear actuator)
- G28 Home position
- G90 Set to absolute positioning (OTTO currently only runs in absolute coordinate mode)
- M150 Setting LED color (Optional feature)
- M701 Load pipette tip
